#### A NEW SHEET

He came to my desk with a quivering lip, the lesson was done.
“Have you a new sheet for me, dear teacher?
I've spoiled this one.”
I took his sheet, all soiled and blotted
and gave him a new one all unspotted.
And into his tired heart I cried,
“Do better now, my child.”

#### A NEW DAY

I went/came to the throne with a trembling heart;
the day was done.
“Have you a new day for me, dear Master?
I've spoiled this one.”
He took my day, all soiled and blotted
and gave me a new one all unspotted.
And into my tired heart he cried,
“Do better now, my child.”
