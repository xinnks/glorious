Look, God, I have never spoken to You. 
But now -- I want to say, "how do you do." 
You see, God, they told me You didn't exist. 
And like a fool -- I believed all of this.

Last night from a shell-hole I saw Your sky -- 
I figured right then, they had told me a lie. 
Had I taken time to see the things You made, 
I'd known they weren't calling a spade a spade.

I wonder, God, if You'd shake my hand. 
Somehow -- I feel that You will understand. 
Funny, -- I had to come to this hellish place, 
Before I had the time to see Your Face.

Well, I guess there isn't much more to say. 
But I'm sure glad, God, I met You today. 
I guess the "zero hour" will soon be here. 
But I'm not afraid since I know You're near.

The signal! -- Well, God, -- I'll have to go. 
I like You lots. -- This I want You to know. 
Look, now -- this will be a horrible fight. 
Who knows -- I may come to Your house tonight.

Though I wasn't friendly with You before 
I wonder, God -- if You'd wait at Your Door. 
Look -- I'm crying!  Me!  -- Shedding tears! 
I wish I'd known You these many years.

Well, I will have to go now, God -- goodbye. 
Strange -- since I met You -- I'm not afraid to die.
